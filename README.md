- 👋 Hi, I’m Justin Brantley ( @jabrantley here on github )

- 👀 I’m interested in movement, the brain, and how those two relate. I've mainly worked in the non-invasive neural interface domain, but have recently been thinking a bit more about motor control, how we learn (and learn to learn), and how this is observed in the real world. My current work is focused on using baseball data to show that professional baseball players behave in a way that is predicted by Bayesian statistics. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bit more about forecasting models, causal inference, Bayesian models, and how to think about baseball more like Bill James

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on cool projects. I know, very specific...

This is my personal repo where I have some code for projects I have worked on throughout the years. Here are some worth mentioning: 

| Project | Description | 
| :---    | :---        |
| `NEUROLEG` | The contains the MATLAB code I used for implementing a real-time EEG- and EMG-based brain-machine interface for amputees | 
| `EmpericalBayes-Baseball` | This is a `python` adaptation of the book [_Introduction to Empirical Bayes: Examples from Baseball Statistics_](https://drob.gumroad.com/l/empirical-bayes) |
| `Deep-Learning` | A (small but on-going) collection of some of my deep learning notebooks. I have many more but I try to clean them up before posting |
| `Baseball_Notebooks` | A few notebooks related to baseball analysis. As I continue to try new things, I will add them to the repo | 
| `JustinBrantley_CV` | The LaTex files for my CV/resume |
| `BasicNeuralPrediction_Example_MATLAB` | A simple tutorial I wrote on how to use `MATLAB` classes for basic prediction using neural data |
| `FigureMaking-MATLAB-EEG` | Some basic tutorials on figure making in `MATLAB`. Check out the corresponding [blog posts](https://jabrantley.github.io/year-archive/) |
